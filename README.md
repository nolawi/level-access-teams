# level-access-teams
a little test

## starting
Couldn't find an api that works so I used, https://github.com/typicode/json-server to create one for localhost

## crud js 
should work with any endpoint, written in babel transpiled. 

## time
I spent a lot more than 3 hours, more like 6 

## Local storage
Left app using local storage with placeholder array from api-json folder, this way i can put this up on github io

### todo
parentid, itemid and description should be fillable too, currently only using placehoder value
